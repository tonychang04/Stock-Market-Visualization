This is a project utilized neural network model [Long short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)
to predict stock prices based on the data from the past days. I used matplotlib to plot the real data
and the prediction data. This project serves as a learning material to let me familiarize with
neural network and matplotlib.
